        <h3>The Italian coffee</h3>

          Latin became the common language for science, English for business but
          when it comes to coffee, Italian is the preferred verbal and written
          code.
          <br /><br />
          Most likely, every coffee shop in the world will present a cappuccino
          or a latte in their menus without giving further explanation of what
          these names mean. These days it’s less rare finding Italian-made
          coffee machines in restaurants and households and the list of Italian
          coffee names on menus seems to keep growing.
          <br /><br />
          I found it fascinating how some of these names mean exactly what you
          would expect them to mean when you think of the coffees named after
          them. For instance, a “latte” main ingredient is milk, so it seems
          pretty obvious to call it so.
          <br /><br />
          Equally fascinating are the names that seem to be more of an analogy.
          Hood? Well, this is a cute one. This name comes from the colour of the
          hooded robes worn by monks and nuns of the Capuchin order.
          <br /><br />
          I’m here not to reveal any secrets. We all know there’s a huge Italian
          influence in Melbourne and coffee’s culture has been imported and
          adapted to the local needs. We have imported the names and techniques
          but we have also added some names to the list, we have our own “flat
          white”, “long black” or “short black”. If someone in Italy is writing
          this same article they would be showing this list:
          <br /><br />
          Nor is it a secret that Brunswick produces good coffee and its
          residents love its culture. Pre, during, and post-work coffees sold
          from a tiny cute window are part of Brunswick street’s daily
          happenings. This dynamic is even more evident during COVID times.
          Making a healthy socially-distanced line to get coffee and being able
          to remove your mask to drink it is an indulgence that even regulation
          affords these bizarre times.
          <br /><br />
          While I enjoy the ritual of leaving my house to get a cup of coffee
          and get the feeling of socialising with the people queuing or with the
          barista I also grew an interest in having a nice home-made coffee. I
          once met an Italian who traveled with her coffee machine in her
          backpack, her name was Alessandra. She was so proud of it and she
          wouldn’t take the chance of not having the coffee the way she wanted.
          This was around eight years ago and to be honest, I found it a bit odd
          because back then I didn’t drink as much coffee as I do now.
          <br /><br />
          Remembering Alessandra, I thought I could get a good Italian coffee
          machine for myself these days. I wandered around Lygon Street and
          Sydney Road looking for a shop that sold this product. Doing my best
          to pay attention but getting easily distracted as it is usually the
          case in these Brunswick streets I couldn’t find a place to get the
          coffee maker. I decided to go get a tap, takeaway-beer at the
          Edinburgh Castle. Proud and happy with my beer but a bit disappointed
          with not finding a coffee machine I walked a little further north on
          Sydney Road.
          <br /><br />
          It must have been destiny because as soon as I raised my eyes, I saw
          the place I was looking for. I could read the word Di Pacci in a black
          and white sign nicely lit outside the business. This was before stage
          4, so they were open for business. I entered the place and as I
          crossed the door, a bell-like sound announced my presence.
