        <h3>Running in Brunswick during Stage 4 restrictions</h3>
        <h3>Guillermo Soria</h3>

        <div class="post-content">
          Well hello, Stage 4. As it has been for the past months, the sudden
          turn of events has become a daily routine for humans in this world. In
          Victoria, we’re currently facing an unprecedented phase that has
          restricted us from doing certain things. Many of those restrictions
          block us from doing activities that bring us joy and at the same time
          grant us the opportunity to appreciate more what we used to take for
          granted.
          <br /><br />
          One of those things is exercise, a medium for us to seek physical and
          mental health. Those of us who enjoy running in Brunswick’s parks,
          streets, or along the Merri Creek wondered if the new constraints
          would limit the way we run. While it depends on how far you like
          running, the restrictions will most likely impact your running
          routine.
          <br /><br />
          We have prepared some information that you will find useful to plan
          your next run. First, the list of the new restrictions, then some
          useful numbers, and finally a couple of routes that you might find fun
          to jog during these winterish days.
          <br /><br />
          Restrictions<br /><br />
          It is important to highlight that yes, you can leave home to run (or
          to do whatever type of exercise you prefer). The limits are the
          following:
          <br /><br />
          You must not travel more than 5km from where you live to exercise<br /><br />
          You can exercise with one other person you live with or a friend or
          family member as long as you both do not travel more than 5km. If you
          are exercising with someone else, because it is safer to do so, you
          should keep at least 1.5 metres distance between you. Don’t hug, kiss
          or shake hands.<br /><br />
          You must limit your exercise to once a day and for no more than one
          hour. <br /><br />
          If you are a parent or guardian who is caring for a child or someone
          who cannot be left unattended then they may go with you<br /><br />
          You can read more details here: Department of Health and Human
          Services.<br /><br />

          Mask or no mask while I run?<br /><br />
          If you are doing exercise or physical activity where you are out of
          breath or puffing, such as jogging or running, you do not need to wear
          a face covering. You do have to carry a face covering with you so you
          can wear it before or after exercising, unless you have a lawful
          exception.

          <br /><br />
          Determine the distance you can run within an hour<br /><br />
          This might take you back to your basic physics lessons at school, but
          if you sucked at it, we will make it easy for you.
          <br /><br />
          Depending on your pace or how fast you can run, you can determine the
          distance you are able to run within the one hour allowed by the rules.
          This means that you need to know your speed or how many minutes it
          takes you to run a whole kilometer to read the tables below.
          <br /><br />

          The table above says that if you run at a pace of 6 minutes per
          kilometer, then the furthest distance you can run within an hour is 10
          kilometers. Similarly, the tables below calculate time and distance
          based on rates of 5 and 4 minutes per kilometer.
          <br /><br />

          Running a minute faster than four minutes per kilometer grants you an
          extra two kilometers. Hence, if you run at a pace of 5 minutes per
          kilometer, the maximum distance you will be able to run within the
          allowed time is twelve kilometers.
          <br /><br />

          If you crave for more distance, speed will give it to you. A steady
          pace of 4 minutes per kilometer will allow you to stay within the time
          permitted while running a distance of 15 kilometers.
          <br /><br />
          Restriction-friendly routes in Brunswick<br /><br />
          Now that you know how long it will take you to run a certain distance
          based on your speed, here are some routes that you can consider
          running within Brunswick.
          <br /><br />
          Prinny – Inner Circle – Creek – Train (PICT)<br /><br />
          Total distance 13km / Paces that fall into the one-hour restriction:
          4:00-4:37min/km / Strava link
          <br /><br />
          Ok, this route is not strictly within Brunswick only but Prinny would
          not care sharing boundaries with people of Brunswick, would it?
          <br /><br />
          I really like this course because you can change scenarios (city,
          creek, park), it is a loop and you do not have to pause your run that
          many times (your knees will welcome that!). Of course, it depends on
          where you start to run but if you wish to replicate it exactly the
          same way as in the picture below, you can find the route here.
          <br /><br />

          Inner Circle – Creek – Train (ICT)<br /><br />
          Total distance: 10km / Paces that fall into the one-hour restriction:
          4:00-6:00min/km / Strava link
          <br /><br />
          You can shorten the previous route by not running Prinny’s circuit or
          by starting off on an east-west/west-east street located closer to
          Brunswick Rd (e.g. Blyth, Albert or Stewart St). This route is almost
          exactly the same as the one mentioned above and the scenarios change
          constantly.
          <br /><br />

          Syd-Cree<br /><br />
          Total distance: 9km / Paces that fall into the one-hour restriction:
          4:00-6:00min/km / Strava link
          <br /><br />
          This route also leaves the Brunswick boundaries but it respects the 5k
          restriction and it is a nice and varied route. What I like the most
          about it is that it visits the northern part of the Merri Creek which
          is way greener, it feels more humid and more natural.
          <br /><br />

          We hope you found this information useful for keeping yourself healthy
          mentally and physically. Remember to respect the rules and to stay
          connected for more information!
