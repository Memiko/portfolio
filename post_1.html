        <h3>What do you understand by bakery?</h3>

        <div class="post-content">
          The imagery that comes to my head when reading the word bakery is
          completely biased by my experience visiting these kinds of businesses
          in the past. The first time I entered A1 Bakery, the collage of images
          in my brain that mostly included cupcakes, loaves of bread, and maybe
          croissants was challenged. I thought I knew what bakery meant but I
          wasn’t even close. <br /><br />
          A1 Bakery brings a new experience to your senses. Visually you are
          attracted to so many things, a big fish tank on your right-hand side,
          to your left you can see two flags proudly hanging from what seems to
          be a balcony, the Australian and Lebanese emblems are almost back to
          back, only divided by the portrait of Charbel Makhlouf, a Lebanese
          saint that typically adorns houses and businesses in the West Asian
          country. <br /><br />
          Your nose perceives familiar smells but its combination makes it very
          particular. Coffee, middle eastern spices, and bread come together to
          add more ingredients to your experience. To be honest, I can’t
          remember if they play any background music but I do recall listening
          to Arabic while queuing and being served. <br /><br />
          During COVID- Stage 3 times, you could line up to get your order taken
          at the till. The menu offers names that for me were brand new. Zaatar,
          Labne and Kishik are names that become familiar when you read their
          last names, Pizza or Pie! I wonder if this last name was a commercial
          trick for us to have a better idea of what to expect. <br /><br />
          After ordering and paying, you receive a ticket with a number which is
          eventually called out. Since many ( if not all) of the food is made at
          the moment of ordering, some larger numbers are called out earlier
          than yours. Don’t be frustrated, maybe you ordered something more
          complex ingredients and preparation wise. <br /><br />
          For me, the senses of taste and touch were most satisfactorily
          awakened. My first time at A1 I remember ordering a cheese pie that
          the bread had just been baked. You could feel it in your hands, the
          pie was warm but not reheated, the dough tasted fresh and the flour
          residue gave it a rustic feeling. <br /><br />
          The taste of halloumi and fresh bread was a killer! I didn’t expect to
          have ordered so much food. Firstly, because I thought a pie was going
          to be smaller and secondly because its price was very affordable. The
          pizza was very exotic to my mouth. I had never had a pizza served cold
          before and the combination of ingredients was just very new to my
          mouth. Yes, I had had olive oil, olives, mint, tomato, cucumber, and
          thickened yogurt before but never at the same time and topping a
          delicious round-shaped bread. <br /><br />
          The concept of a bakery was beautifully challenged in every sense.
          Today, I like understanding the concept of a bakery as a place
          committed to cooking bread with fresh ingredients and I thank A1
          bakery for that. <br /><br />
          I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this restaurant for Brunswick
          residents and not residents (within a 5km radius, remember!).
