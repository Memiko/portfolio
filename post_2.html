        <h3>The other way around, and list of books</h3>

          How much context should one as a writer give to the reader? Why does
          calling myself a writer feel cocky? Are writers cocky because they’re
          writers or is it the other way around? –> are cocky people writers
          because they’re cocky?
          <br /><br />
          Anyway, today is a cloudy day in Brunswick, a suburb in Melbourne,
          Australia, my home for the past four months. What has living here
          inspired me to do? What has the pandemic? What have the stars, the
          oceans, and the colours of the sky? We like attributing our actions to
          our surroundings or is it the other way around? –> we like attributing
          our surroundings to our actions. I feel the latter is what ‘being in
          control’ could mean. We define our surroundings through the power of
          our actions. Cause and effect. Happenings. Logic. Stories. Control.
          <br /><br />
          Enough context.
          <br /><br />
          Two nights ago I couldn’t sleep and a memory crossed my mind. I had a
          list of all the books I read while traveling last year. This is
          between 26 March 2019 and 4 March 2020. This is the list in
          chronological order (from March 2019 to March 2020):
          <br /><br />
          La borra del café (Coffee Dregs) by Mario Benedetti. While in Mexico.
          I stumbled across this one because my father noticed I was reading
          another book (Antología Poética) by the same author. I told him a
          friend gave it to me and I was liking it. He gave Coffe Dregs to me
          saying “you might like it as well!”. I did. I enjoyed reading a
          child’s story from his own eyes as he grew up. Family relationships,
          love, friendship, dreams, and tragedy encapsulated in a cute but deep
          story.
          <br /><br />Luz Interna (Inner Light) by Jose Agustin. While in
          Mexico. I found it in a bookshelf in my parents’ house. I had read it
          when I was in my twenties, however, it felt like reading something
          brand new. Hippies and beatniks culture juxtaposed with Mexico’s
          intricate social structure… nice! <br /><br />The Industrial
          Revolution 1760-1830 by T.S. Ashton. While in Mexico, the USA, and the
          UK (England and Scotland). Bought this one in a second-hand-bookshop
          owned by an Argentinian after drinking ‘mate’ (pronounced mah-teh) in
          Cholula, Puebla. Too academic and hence dense, but interesting to read
          while being in three different countries and most definitely lively
          while in Manchester. <br /><br />Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino.
          While in the UK (England and Scotland), Spain, and France. I Airbnb’d
          in Edinburgh, Scotland. The room I stayed at belonged to a ‘housing
          geek’ and the book was sitting on his shelf along with many others. I
          browsed through it and decided to get myself a copy in a local
          bookshop. Imaginatively and intense short stories full of colours,
          parallel realities, and philosophy. <br /><br />Blink: The power of
          thinking without thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. While in France,
          Switzerland and Italy. When an overthinker reads that title it’s easy
          to think that I would think less after reading it, of course!…. I
          wasn’t… or was I? Well, maybe I was and/or I wasn’t but I think I
          haven’t unconsciously thought about it. <br /><br />The Pursuit of
          Italy by David Gilmore. While in Italy and Australia. I found it in
          the house/farm where I was volunteering in Pontremoli, Italy. Always
          catchy to read the story of a country from a foreigner, immigrant,
          outsider’s perspective. Extra insights while being in Italy and while
          having to come back and forth to and from Australia to present my
          citizenship test. <br /><br />The Purple Swamp Hen by Penelope Lively.
          While in Australia and Greece. I stumbled across this book on a train
          while exploring the Cinque Terre region in Italy. Someone forgot it
          and it became temporarily mine. It made me think of how little I read
          books written by women authors. I enjoyed reading short stories from a
          woman’s perspective, it felt emotional and powerful (is that where the
          empowered word/feeling comes from?). I kept it with me until I left it
          in an airport’s waiting room in Chennai, India. I can only hope
          someone found it and enjoyed it as much as I did. <br /><br />The
          Language of Cities by Deyan Sudjic. While in Greece and Bulgaria.
          Another book I found in that Edinburgh’s room full of
          housing-material. I got myself a Kindle version of it. What a pleasure
          to travel and learn about urban planning and what cities tell us about
          culture, policies, and history through their design. <br /><br />Lady
          by (…). While in Bulgaria. This was a black book with a picture of an
          elegant black-hatted lady and I just can’t remember who wrote it and I
          curiously can’t find it on the internet (!). I found it in a house
          where I stayed in Sofia, Bulgaria. I found the characters disengaging
          and the narrative extremely prude. I didn’t finish this one.
          <br /><br />The Diamond as Big as the Ritz, and Other Stories by F.
          Scott Fitzgerald. While in Turkey and Oman. I bought it from a guy who
          sold second-hand books in Istanbul on the street. I can’t properly
          describe what it was but I couldn’t finish reading it. I only read a
          few stories and I found it dense, it was good at building my
          expectations but clumsy at fulfilling them. <br /><br />Las Tierras
          Arrasadas (The razed lands) by Emiliano Monge. While in India. I can’t
          recall how I got to this book. I read it in my Kindle. I came back to
          Spanish after eight books. I can just say the rhythm at which the
          story was written wasn’t the same rhythm at which I was traveling so I
          found it dull. I felt the author took as much effort to finish writing
          it as I did reading it. <br /><br />Slow man by J.M. Coetzee. While in
          India and Singapore. It was at my favourite hostel in India (Electric
          Cats Hostel at Munnar) where I found this book. It was a refreshing,
          easy-to-read, and an insightful combination of words. Based in
          Adelaide, Australia where I lived for five years brought an extra
          connection. Immigration, racism, magic, and ageing are some of the
          (sometimes) subtly mentioned topics of this book.
          <br /><br />Introduction to Muhammed. While in Malaysia. This was a
          book I couldn’t finish reading because I had to leave it in the house
          where it belonged before getting to the end. Being in a (mostly)
          Muslim country I enjoyed learning a bit more about Islam, the Koran,
          and its founder in a ‘for dummies’ formatted book. <br /><br />Pedro
          Paramo by Juan Rulfo. While in Vietnam. While at uni, there was a
          ‘quiz night’ question that for some reason came up repeatedly while we
          played a board game named “Maraton“. Who wrote Pedro Paramo? I knew
          the answer but never read the book. For some reason, I thought about
          this while in Vietnam. I got the Kindle version of it. One of the most
          enjoyable books I’ve ever read. Juan Rulfo smartly plays with
          timelines and parallel realities located in obscure but joyful
          scenarios that made me wonder about my own perception of culture,
          life, and death through blurry but steady characters. <br /><br />The
          Prophet by Kahlil Gibran. While in Vietnam. This book was a
          recommendation given to me by a Palestinian friend whom I met in
          India. If I’m honest I haven’t finished it. With the same honesty, I
          must say I have started it three times. Its messages are
          philosophically deep and inspirational. They match very much the way I
          see (or would like to see) things. Amongst other topics, it literally
          talks about love, marriage, work, and home. <br /><br />The Sun Also
          Rises by Ernest Hemingway. While in Vietnam. One of my beloved travel
          companions (and a reading machine) finished reading it and transferred
          it to me, he said I would enjoy it. Oh my, I did! I once read
          Hemingway at school but never paid attention to the details. I also
          think that reading him in its original language was eye-opening. The
          sweet and sour drama of love written beautifully. <br /><br />What is
          the cause and effect of what we read and who we are? Are we what we
          read or is it the other way around? –> Is what we read what it is
          because we are who we are? <br /><br />
          Making sense of cause and effect and its intricacies are just part of
          who we are (…and of what we read?). Thinking about the books I read
          last year makes me believe that stories captured in words are as good
          or as bad as the causes and effects that make sense to us at a certain
          point in our lives. Suddenly, it feels obvious to see that the cause
          rules the effect, or is it the other way around?
